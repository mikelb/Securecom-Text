Securecom Text
==============

Securecom Text is a messaging app for easy private communication with friends.

Securecom Text uses SMS to communicate securely, and all Securecom Text
messages can also be encrypted locally on your device. It is designed to
replace the default SMS application for Android.

Securecom Text is based on TextSecure from Open WhisperSystems. With Securecom
Text all communication is exclusively by SMS/MMS. As support for communication
over data/push messaging has been removed, Google Play infrastructure is not
required for operation.

Currently available on the Play store.
